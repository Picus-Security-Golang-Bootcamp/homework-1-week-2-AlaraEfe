## Homework 1 | Week 2

This program contains a list of books.

This program has two tasks.

* To show whole list of the books in the program as an output.
* If the list contains the name of the book received as input, the program gives the name of that book as an output.

go run main.go list
```

``` 
* The 'search' command should be used to gives the name of that book as output if the list contains the name of the that book
